Game Engines Assignment Proposal --- C16409712

For this assignment, I plan to create a procedurally generated cave system. The camera will move through the cave on a predetermined  track, with the player using the mouse to freely look around the cavern as they move. The cave will be lined with glowing crystals, wall and stalactites, which will all be spawned procedually. The colour and glow strength of the crystals will be determined by a music track, providing brighter colours and stronger glows at higher volume and intensity of the audio. I would also like to implement a random chance for the crystals to shatter as the camera passes.
